About Me Section Draft (147 words) -------------------------------------- > Hey there! I'm Manasa – a passionate full-stack developer who loves turning wild ideas into pixel-perfect reality. Currently crushing my BTech (Class of 2028), but I've been coding since before it was cool to have "developer" in your bio. > > My superpower? Building seamless web experiences that make users go "wow, that just works!" From crafting responsive frontends with React and Vue to architecting robust backends with Python and Django, I speak fluent code in multiple dialects. > > When I'm not debugging at 2 AM (okay, maybe I am), you'll find me exploring the latest web technologies, creating digital designs in Illustrator, or helping teams bring their visions to life through clear communication and solid project management. > > I believe great software isn't just about clean code – it's about solving real problems for real people.
